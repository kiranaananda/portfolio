<h3>The case</h3>

Bibit is a mutual fund investment platform focusing primarily on first-time investors. Our group vision is to help Indonesians manage their personal finances and invest in the right products so that they can improve their lives by achieving their goals and needs in the future. This year, Bibit has reached 5 Million users. To continue our leads in Indonesia, the goal is to help us gather insights from the people's perspective of Bibit as a brand and how we should position ourselves as compared to our competitors.
<hr>

<h3>Background and assumptions</h3>

Background
- Bibit has achieved 5 million users and is planning sustainable user growth among first-time investors.
- Bibit is in search of the right brand positioning to engage with its target market and win over competitors.

Assumptions to formulate problem statements
- The right segment leads to the right brand positioning. When brand positioning has not been made, it may be true that Bibit is still searching for the right segment too.
- The market size tells the growth direction: internet penetration is 73.7% (202 million), but Bibit share is 2.5% among the general population. Despite the fact that a real market size would be accountable once the right segment (targeted population) has been met, 5 million must not be saturated yet.
- Brand must map the needs and attitudes of its segment in order to create brand positioning. Baker et al. (2018) suggest one can classify investors through social demographics: age, gender, and wealth to be applied as initial criteria, but of course that’s not enough, so it’s our chance to comprehend the findings.

<h3>Research designs and questions</h3>

Research questions
- How are the characteristics of our segment?
- How are the decision steps (this includes but is not limited to the dynamics of psychological processes, trigger identification, and barrier identification) of their investing behavior?
- What are the comparative motives (pre and post thoughts) of their investing behavior?
- What are the important attributes (key drivers, hygiene, and opportunity) for the investment sector?
- What brand image that is already owned or can be strengthen by any of investment brands?

Research design

The main objectives above actually lie in how to tap into the target market. In order to deepen the knowledge and avoid heuristics, I propose to have a two-phase study: qualitative (especially when we do not have enough clarity on the sector) and quantitative (as a guide for business decisions in a more reliable manner).
<hr>

<h3>Research plan phase 1: qualitative</h3>

Purposive sampling, with criteria: 
- First-time investor from Baker et al. (2018)
- Male/female
- Start investing since November 2019 (2 years from data collection) in securities companies.
- Age: 18+
- More than 1 share in any stock, mutual fund, crypto, or obligation portfolio
- Additional criteria that fit with the Bibit target: have used at least an investment app (e.g., Bibit, Ajaib, Bareksa, Mandiri Sekuritas, etc.)

Design: in-depth interview, @45 minutes

Sample size: 3 to 8 individuals shall be enough

Timeline: 1-1.5 months
- interview guideline: 3 days
- participant soucing: 3-7 days
- fieldwork: 3-10 days (tentative)
- synthesis with thematic analysis: 2-5 days
- reporting: 5 days

Main questions
- As you have said that you are (mention the characteristics: e.g., have joined Ajaib in 6 months / currently have 2 stocks and 2 mutual funds in Ajaib / are always adding more funding on a monthly basis, are actively reading the investment news)... can I ask you to go back to the state when you first had the idea about investing and tell me how it has gone from that point to now?
- Could you please explain to me in any form what you know about your current brand?
- What makes you stay with your current brand as well as your investment instruments?
- What must be owned by a brand to make someone like you stick with them?
- Are you considering switching to another brand? If yes, what are the brand activities that might move you?
<hr>

<h3>Research plan phase 2: quantitative</h3>

Criteria follow the qualitative one.

Design: survey with 35-45 questions.

Sample size: a minimum of n = 385 (MoE 5%), but strongly suggest n = 1000 (MoE 3%) for readable segments.

Questionnaire skeleton:
<ul>
 <li>Brand performance: top of mind, awareness, current used brand, brand used most often, future consideration</li>
 <li>Brand importance and image: a list of attributes gathered from qualitative data</li>
 <li>Persona questions</li>
 <li>Investment occasion</li>
 <li>Attitude:
  <ul>
   <li>5-point scales of psychological assessment: worldview, e.g., risk attitude, financial decision</li>
   <li>Activities, media, and demographics</li>
   <li>Social media activity</li>
   <li>Lifestyle, e.g., dining out, hobbies</li>
   <li>Age, gender, net worth, education, income, area, SES</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>
Analysis: cross-tabulation, reliability test, and hierarchial clustering
