<p>In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of customer behavior based on data gathered through extensive market research helped by a vendor. Utilizing advanced clustering techniques, I identified distinct customer segments with shared behavioral characteristics. Each segment was meticulously profiled, enabling targeted marketing strategies tailored to their preferences. These insights led to significant improvements in campaign effectiveness, resource allocation optimization, and customer satisfaction. By understanding the diverse behaviors of distinct customer segments, the growth team was empowered to deploy more effective and personalized marketing strategies.</p>
