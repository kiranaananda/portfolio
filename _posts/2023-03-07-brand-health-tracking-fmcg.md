In this research, I use a combination of quantitative surveys and data analysis techniques with dummy data to present an overview of brand health tracking initiatives within the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry. Iâ€™d like to discuss relevant problems and strategic objectives for Lion, a made-up company that works in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry, using fictitious data. Through detailed analysis and exploration, I seek to uncover existing challenges that require resolution, identify key short-term objectives critical for immediate progress, and delineate long-term aspirations spanning various domains including brand development, creative endeavors, media strategies, innovation initiatives, and commerce. Please check it out and feel free to reach out for further discussion or insights!
