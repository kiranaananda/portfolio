In this project, I show a summary of brand health tracking initiatives within the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, employing a blend of quantitative surveys and data analysis techniques with dummy data. With the aid of dummy data, I aim to address pertinent issues and strategic goals for Lion, a fictional brand operating within the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. Through detailed analysis and exploration, I seek to uncover existing challenges that require resolution, identify key short-term objectives critical for immediate progress, and delineate long-term aspirations spanning various domains including brand development, creative endeavors, media strategies, innovation initiatives, and commerce endeavors. By delving into these areas, I aim to provide actionable insights and strategic recommendations to drive Lion's growth and success in a dynamic market landscape. Please check it out and feel free to reach out for further discussion or insights!
