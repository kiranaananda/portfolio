Integration and connectedness are keys to organizational development alongside with data-driven decision making and intelligent network. To compensate the transformational changes, most of the human resources departments claim their fond for the situation by reforming their framework into collaboration and collegiality settings. Those variables are believed to make everything more efficient and convenient yet friendly towards informational uncertainty.

Earlier, cooperation was all we need, but now it could be not enough. Working behaviour has changed and has revolved to something more than just cooperation. According to Sharpe, Lounsbery and Templin (1997), we could never only depend on cooperative behaviour because we needed collegiality and collaboration to bear works. They stated that collegiality was needed to ensure if the task had been distributed equally, while collaboration was important to contextualize mutual respect, trust and honesty in the team.

Nevertheless, there might be situations that are far from the ideal one. For example, teams are vulnerable to free riders, a phenomenon of social loafing that effects are causing injustice in the task distribution due to lack of responsibility in some people. Within the situation, you still have the duty to fill yourself with those out-of-your-education skills set as the after effect of collaboration and stand out in the cross-functional team to achieve daily goals. While you have all the problems by yourself, reversely, you are still demanded to develop prosocial behaviour at your office. Have you ever been there yet you decided to quit your job?

If you say yes, probably, your fairness-sensing was working, better than your earlier generations. Generally speaking, people uphold benevolence represented in the quality of their fairness and prosocial behaviour. Fairness is a sense of equity and equality shown in the way people negotiate and handle task distribution with colleagues. Further, prosocial behaviour is an act of helping behaviour which impact is affecting self-worth. By helping people and carefully addressing their need, you will be respected as a kind and trustworthy person. Imagine if you are engaged with free riders, what emotion might come?

To prove the assumptions of prosocial behaviour in collaboration, I made a vignette for my undergraduate thesis consisted of the situation in which the participants had to decide whether they would continue to collaborate with a selfless (helper trait without ulterior motives) and selfish (helper trait with ulterior motives) randomly. When integrity and ability were all good, they still refused to work with a selfish person. Why were integrity and ability not enough? What is the reason behind this?

Theoretically, in the frame of human as social beings, perceived benevolence contributes to collaboration through the potentiality of friendships (Chung, Lount, Park, & Park, 2018). In the perspective of interpersonal relationships, friendships tend to increase commitment, motivation, satisfaction and socialization in collaboration (Winstead, Derlega, Montgomery, & Pilkington, 1995). Furthermore, Polterovich (2017) also mentioned that prosocial behaviour considered as an important factor in increasing individual involvement in collaboration. The theory suggests that benevolence in the form of prosocial behaviour is the basis of social interactions.

Practically, most people do not befriend their colleagues in the sense of close relationships. Working environments shape people to behave in transactional relationships so that to give vulnerability to colleagues is quite risky and strange. The research may imply in the situation where the working environments are unknown. In those situations, people use basic instincts and interact in as social as possible, hoping if someone will benevolence enough to them. In other words, they prefer to work with one who kind rather than competent and honest in clueless situations to keep off social uncertainty.

Benevolence can be a positive trait for newcomers, but integrity and ability are the variables that highly valued by your employer. Some talent management does not measure performance based on your sociability and how comfortable you are with each other. Benevolence is for your convenience, but ability and integrity are ones that you can depend on for working performance.

Still, if you are too kind, you are vulnerable to being used by the opportunist. This situation suggests implying benevolence in mutualism situations. Benevolence is related to fairness-sensing, if you manage to be ignorance and care at the right amount, you will sense fairness better than before. Further, if benevolence does not interact with integrity, it could end in communal deceptions. Please carefully adjust your benevolence, integrity and ability to be a trustworthy employee.
